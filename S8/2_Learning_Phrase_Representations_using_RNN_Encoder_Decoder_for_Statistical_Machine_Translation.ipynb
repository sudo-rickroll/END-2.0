        "\n",
        "In this second notebook on sequence-to-sequence models using PyTorch and TorchText, we'll be implementing the model from [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078). This model will achieve improved test perplexity whilst only using a single layer RNN in both the encoder and the decoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's remind ourselves of the general encoder-decoder model.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/seq2seq1.png?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "We use our encoder (green) over the embedded source sequence (yellow) to create a context vector (red). We then use that context vector with the decoder (blue) and a linear layer (purple) to generate the target sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous model, we used an multi-layered LSTM as the encoder and decoder.\n",

        "\n",
        "One downside of the previous model is that the decoder is trying to cram lots of information into the hidden states. Whilst decoding, the hidden state will need to contain information about the whole of the source sequence, as well as all of the tokens have been decoded so far. By alleviating some of this information compression, we can create a better model!\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also be using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) instead of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). Why? Mainly because that's what they did in the paper (this paper also introduced GRUs) and also because we used LSTMs last time. To understand how GRUs (and LSTMs) differ from standard RNNS, check out [this](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) link. Is a GRU better than an LSTM? [Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555) has shown they're pretty much the same, and both are better than standard RNNs. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Preparing Data\n",
        "\n",
        "All of the data preparation will be (almost) the same as last time, so we'll very briefly detail what each code block does. See the previous notebook for a recap.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll import PyTorch, TorchText, spaCy and a few standard modules."

        "\n",
        "Before, we predicted the next token, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$, with the linear layer, $f$, only using the top-layer decoder hidden state at that time-step, $s_t$, as $\\hat{y}_{t+1}=f(s_t^L)$. Now, we also pass the embedding of current token, $d(y_t)$ and the context vector, $z$ to the linear layer.\n",

        "How do these two changes reduce the information compression? Well, hypothetically the decoder hidden states, $s_t$, no longer need to contain information about the source sequence as it is always available as an input. Thus, it only needs to contain information about what tokens it has generated so far. The addition of $y_t$ to the linear layer also means this layer can directly see what the token is, without having to get this information from the hidden state. \n",

        "However, this hypothesis is just a hypothesis, it is impossible to determine how the model actually uses the information provided to it (don't listen to anyone that says differently). Nevertheless, it is a solid intuition and the results seem to indicate that this modifications are a good idea!\n",

        "Within the implementation, we will pass $d(y_t)$ and $z$ to the GRU by concatenating them together, so the input dimensions to the GRU are now `emb_dim + hid_dim` (as context vector will be of size `hid_dim`). The linear layer will take $d(y_t), s_t$ and $z$ also by concatenating them together, hence the input dimensions are now `emb_dim + hid_dim*2`. We also don't pass a value of dropout to the GRU as it only uses a single layer.\n",
