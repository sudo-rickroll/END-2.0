Stanford Tree Bank is a dataset used for sentiment analysis. It contains sentiment values for phrases and sentences containing those phrases. Every sentence has a sentiment value and the phrases making that sentence are further broken down into smaller parts and they have been assigned some sentiment values as well.
The Sentiment Values for the phrases range from 0 to 1. The ranges for different sentiments are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> 0 ≤ Value < 0.2 -> Very Negative</li>
  <li> 0.2 ≤ Value < 0.4 -> Negative</li>
  <li> 0.4 ≤ Value < 0.6 -> Neutral</li>
  <li> 0.6 ≤ Value < 0.8 -> Positive</li>
  <li> 0.8 ≤ Value ≤ 1 -> Very Positive</li>
</ul>
